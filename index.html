<!-- ================= WHY CALCULATORS MATTER ================= -->
<section class="card" style="margin-bottom:3rem">
  <h2>Why Financial Calculators Are Important</h2>
  <p>
    Financial decisions such as taking a loan or starting an investment plan have long-term consequences.
    A small difference in interest rate, tenure or monthly contribution can result in
    lakhs of rupees difference over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Financial calculators help you visualize these differences before committing your money.
    They allow you to compare scenarios, test assumptions and choose options that align with your financial goals.
